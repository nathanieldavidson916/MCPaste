# MCPaste

MCPaste is a simple and efficient macOS application that enhances your productivity by binding the middle mouse click to an AppleScript action that pastes the current contents of the clipboard. This application is designed for users seeking a quicker way to paste clipboard contents without traditional keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- **Middle Mouse Click Paste:** Simply click your middle mouse button to paste the clipboard contents anywhere that supports paste functionality.
- **Lightweight and Efficient:** Runs quietly in the background, using minimal system resources.
- **Easy to Use:** No complicated setup required. Install and start pasting immediately with your middle mouse button.

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** macOS 14.4 or later
- **Hardware:** Mac with a middle mouse button

## Installation

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/nathanieldavidson916/MCPaste/releases) page. The latest build is provided as a zip archive. Open the downloaded file and drag the MCPaste application to your Applications folder.

### Configuring Permissions

For MCPaste to function correctly, you must enable certain permissions:
- **Accessibility:** MCPaste requires accessibility permissions to simulate the paste command.
- **Automation:** Allow automation permissions to let MCPaste run AppleScript.

Launch MCPaste, and it will start operating in the background.

## Usage

Once MCPaste is running, simply use the middle mouse button to paste the clipboard's contents in any text field or application that supports pasting. MCPaste does not modify your clipboard contents.
